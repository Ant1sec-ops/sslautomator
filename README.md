# sslautomator.sh

**sslautomator.sh** is a bash script designed to automate SSL/TLS certificate checks for multiple websites. It reads a list of URLs from a file and performs a series of SSL/TLS checks on each site to ensure the certificates are valid, secure, and not nearing expiration. This tool is particularly useful for system administrators and security professionals who need to regularly monitor the SSL status of multiple domains.

## How It Works

1. **Input File**: The script takes a file containing a list of URLs as input. Each URL should be on a new line in the text file (e.g., `url-list.txt`).

2. **SSL/TLS Checks**: For each URL in the input file, `sslautomator.sh`:
   - Connects to the URL over HTTPS.
   - Retrieves the SSL/TLS certificate details.
   - Checks the certificate's expiration date, ensuring itâ€™s valid and not close to expiring.
   - Verifies the certificate against a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   - Identifies any potential security issues, such as weak ciphers or outdated protocols.

3. **Output**: The results of the checks are displayed in the terminal, providing information about the status of each certificate, including any warnings or errors that might need attention.

## Usage

To use `sslautomator.sh`, follow these steps:

1. **Create a URL list file**: Create a text file (e.g., `url-list.txt`) with a list of URLs you want to check, each on a new line.

   Example `url-list.txt`:
   ```
   https://example.com
   https://example2.com
   https://example3.com


   
   ```

2. **Run the script**: Use the following command to execute the script, passing in your URL list file:

   ```bash
   ./sslautomator.sh url-list.txt
   ```

3. **Review the output**: The script will output the SSL/TLS check results directly to the terminal, detailing the status of each site's certificate.

**Note:** Ensure that the script has executable permissions and sslscan is install. You can set this by running:

```bash
chmod +x sslautomator.sh
sudo apt install sslscan -y
```

## Example

Running the script with an example URL list:

```bash
./sslautomator.sh url-list.txt
```

## Requirements

- **Bash**: The script is written in bash, so it requires a Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows.
- **OpenSSL**: The script utilizes `openssl` for checking SSL/TLS certificates. Ensure that `openssl` is installed and accessible from your terminal.
